# programming2Project
Music visualiser

Tasks:
What needs to be done?
    1. Plan an idea for the final project extension (2-3 additional extensions, two of medium complexity and one quite complex)
    2. Implement the extension for the audio visualiser
    3. Make changes and amendments to the extension, record changes in log and as git commits
    
How will we know it's done?
    1. Idea choices may be revised once or twice, but the choices will be noted in the logs. Once my partner and I agree on an idea, we will write it down.
    2. The implementation will be done once we have gone through the video and completed and tested each task.
    3. The changes will be improvements, so maybe making it look better or adding a little more functionality. We will decide on 1 or 2 things to improve.
    
Who is responsible?
    1. We don't both need to come up with an idea, but if one of us disagrees with an idea then the person should suggest another.
    2. We will split the tasks in some systematic way, and we are both responsible for helping each other.
    3. We should both add improvements individually.

Can it be done in the available time?
